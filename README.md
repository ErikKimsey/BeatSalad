# BeatSalad
### BeatSalad is the product of day's worth of UI experimentation using Unity3D's audio features and drag-and-drop functionality.
#### Materials: Unity3D, Blender, and Propellerhead's Reason.

Each capsule "contains" an isolated audio loop (e.g., a bass-line or drum loop).  When capsules come into contact with one another, each capsule's audio will begin playback.
